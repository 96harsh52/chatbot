Air conditioning units, on average, last between 10-15 years. While typically reliable during their lifespan, AC replacement is sometimes necessary. There are a few telltale signs to be aware of in case you suspect you need an air conditioning replacement. Water residue buildup around the unit, a strange odor, blowing hot air, and high humidity levels inside your home or business are all warning signs that your air conditioning unit might be on the fritz. If you suspect you might be in need of AC replacement, contact our team of air conditioning installation contractors right away! What to Consider When Buying a New AC There are many factors that come into play when buying a new AC system. Perhaps the most important consideration is the cooling capacity. If your unit is not capable of cooling the amount of air needed in your home or business, the expense of the system will be for naught. Other factors such as energy efficiency, manufacturer’s warranties, and brand reliability should also be considered before investing in a new AC installation. All American Plumbing Heating & Air is here to help answer your questions on air conditioning systems before you buy! Mini Split Ductless Air Conditioning Installation For reliable air conditioning without the need for costly HVAC work, mini split ductless air conditioning systems are a great option. When installing mini split ductless A/C units, each “zone” (or room) of your home will have its own individual unit. This allows for each room to be cooled to a specific temperature, rather than having one centralized temperature setting. Mini split ductless air conditioning units can also be turned off completely when they’re not needed, resulting in potential energy and utility cost savings. If you’re considering a ductless A/C system, give us a call. Our team is highly skilled in mini split ductless air conditioning installation and can help you in finding the best unit(s) for your specific needs and budget. Residential Air Conditioning Installation There are many options for homeowners when it comes to air conditioning systems. Central air conditioning is the most widely known option, providing reliable cooling throughout the home with an outdoor compressor and indoor ductwork. While central A/C is a popular choice, it’s not always the best one. Some homeowners are unable to install central air without spending a small fortune on HVAC work. In this case, homeowners turn to ductless systems. Mini-split, ductless air conditioning installation is a very reliable option that does not require HVAC work and still provides effective cooling in most situations.
