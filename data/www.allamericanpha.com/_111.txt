To unplug a shower. Half was thru the process he said he had to clear the drain and added another 330. More on top of the 304 that I committed to. Where he opened the drain all the waste ended under my barbecue area. He put the stuff back under the barbecue on top of all the waste that came out.I always thought that the owner was a good guy but their business practice sucks.Useful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationLamont G.Business OwnerApr 20, 2022We have contacted Darell to do our best in correcting the poor experience received, this is not the type of experience we consistently train our team members to provide. The team member has been counselled extensively to ensure this type of experience does not repeat itself.We sincerely apologize for the experience received and have ensured this will not happen again.

The repairman was pushing for us to buy a new water heater to the tune of 2500-3000. He lied about the age of the water heater, and said it was 16 years old, when I found out it was 6 years old. He was quite impatient and arrogant as well. I ended up having a different plumber come out, and he fixed the water heater for under 700. I will not call them again.Useful 1FunnyCoolBusiness owner informationLamont G.Business OwnerJun 4, 2022Raymond, we're sorry to hear you didn't enjoy the service our team provided. We stand behind our team and their decisions. According to your water heater's serial number, your water heater is 8+ years old. Because of the area's hard water, water heaters in our area only last around 8 to 12 years. When a water heater falls within this age range, and depending on its condition and the repairs needed, we suggest replacement as to save you money on continual repairs that could wisely go toward a newer more efficient water heater. If our team felt strongly that your water heater needed to be replaced, we trust that decision. We wish you the best moving forward. Kindly, Lamont G., PresidentTo learn more about how to determine the age of your water heater using your serial number please reference this link: https://www.bradfordwhite.com/forthepro-bulletins/determining-the-age-of-a-water-heater/ Read moreCharla S.Atwater, CA010Jun 16, 2022This company will charge you an arm and a leg. They took advantage of my young (20) year old daughter. Charged her $300+ for a clogged kitchen sink that took him 20 mins to clear!!! Then he was asking too many personal questions!!! Then asked her to do a survey for his bonus!! Take it out of the $300 you charged buddy!!UsefulFunnyCoolRichard E.SoMa, San Francisco, CA01Jul 22, 2021Good service. But stupid pricing . My home is only 1,000 sq ft.I wanted my new smart thermostat installed. And have my A/cunit checked to see if it needed to be charged. He said my unit had beenworked on before and it was old. quoted me $7,500 just to patch it up.didn't include a compressor. He suggested I replace my Heater and A/Cunit for $15,000. because they we're old. So I asked how much jut to installthe smart thermostat quoted $425.00. I had my Daughters boy friend installit in 20 min. He is Auto mechanic. Friendly and on time is nice, but not worththat much.
