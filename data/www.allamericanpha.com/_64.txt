The best way to prevent repair issues with your natural gas piping is to have it professionally installed by skilled and experienced plumbers. Even with that, however, you may still have a problem crop up. And when it does, it needs to be addressed right away. There is no point in taking risks when it comes to your gas lines. Ignoring a potential issue could be harmful to both your health and safety. One symptom of a gas line problem is the smell of rotten eggs—this is an odor that your gas company purposefully puts in the gas so that you can detect if you have a gas leak. Do You Need Natural Gas Piping in Your Home? Using natural gas, or even propane, in your home provides a number of benefits. One of the biggest advantages is the affordability of gas-powered appliances. When compared to electric appliances, gas–powered systems provide significant savings. Many people find that they even prefer certain aspects of using gas over electric—such as in cooking on a stovetop. Gas piping has a number of applications in the average Central Valley, CA home. This includes: Stove and Cooktop Cooking: As we said above, some people prefer cooking with a gas stovetop versus an electric system. This is because you can control the heat much quicker and more easily with a flame. Gas Water Heaters: Electric water heaters are certainly a great option for installation. However, many folks prefer gas water hears due to the affordability of running such a system month to month. Outdoor BBQ: Whether you have hard gas lines or flexible gas lines installed, they can be used for an outdoor barbeque. This way, you won’t have to worry about swapping out propane tanks. Plus if you have a custom setup that requires gas piping, then flexible gas lines can be incredibly beneficial, as can our underground pipe fusion services, allowing us to easily install new gas lines or retrofit existing gas lines. What if You Detect a Gas Leak? If you suspect you are facing a gas leak or any other sort of gas line problem, then be sure to exit your home immediately and either call your utility company or 911. Once your home is cleared for re-entry, our team can help establish the cause of the leak and repair it, permanently. You can count on our licensed Central Valley plumbers for safe and effective gas line services—reach out to our experienced team today! 6 Year complete warranty on all plumbing work except fixtures available to our AMP club maintenance program members.
