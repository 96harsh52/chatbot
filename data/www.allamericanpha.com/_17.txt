More About Whole House Repiping Since most of your plumbing system is hidden from view, it can be a challenge to know when the pipes are suffering. While maintenance, as we mentioned above, is the best way for you to keep tabs on your plumbing system, there are a number of warning signs to be aware of between maintenance appointments, which can indicate the need for repiping. Keep the following symptoms in mind, and if you have any concerns about the condition of your plumbing pipes, contact our Central Valley plumbing service professionals to come take a look: Drop in Water Pressure: Is this occurring in a single pipe? It could be an isolated incident and you might get by with a simple pipe repair or drain repair. But if it’s throughout the home, and sewer line or mainline problems have been ruled out, then it could be that you have breaches in your pipes due to old age, and therefore require whole house repiping. Frequent Water Leaks: Do you find yourself having leak repairs done on your pipes pretty frequently? This is usually a sign that your pipes are corroding, and repiping should certainly be considered. Increase in Water Bills: Unfortunately, if you have hidden leaks due to corrosion and experience a drop in water pressure as a result, you probably will also be paying for more water than you’re actually using! Common Signs That You May Need Repiping In Your Home Have you noticed a change in the taste, smell, and color of the water in your home? Was there a recent spike in your water bill? These are common signs that you may need repiping in your home. When pipes become old they can corrode and contaminate your water as well as cause poor water flow. Corrosion can also lead to leaks and water damage in your home if not treated properly. Depending on the age or corrosion level of your pipes it may be time for a whole house repiping service. Luckily our knowledgeable professionals can evaluate the situation and advise the best course of action.
