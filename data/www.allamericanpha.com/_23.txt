The use of forced-air heating systems such as furnaces and heat pumps is widespread throughout the Central Valley area. However, they are not the only option for whole home heating. Hydronic boiler systems have grown in popularity recently due to their efficiency, clean operation, and the fact that they allow for efficient floor and baseboard heating. Like all heating systems, however, boilers can only work as effectively and efficiently as they’re meant to if they are professionally installed by a team of service professionals with extensive training and experience. You have that with our boiler repair experts. Schedule your first appointment by calling our team today at (209) 509-4448 or use our online form. We are proud to serve customers in Los Banos, Turlock, Merced, Patterson, and the surrounding Central Valley areas. How Does a Boiler Work? Hydronic boiler systems function by heating water to a temperature between 120–140°F, then distributing that water through a series of pipes in your home. These pipes feed into either baseboard heaters, floorboards, radiators, or some combination of all three. What makes this process more efficient than forced-air heating is that the heat dissipates slowly and spreads evenly throughout your home. Boilers also help with any air quality problems you may be experiencing in the home, which we’ll get to below. Your air quality can be supplemented, too, with the right air purifier and humidity balancing system. Expert Boiler Installation There are several advantages to having a boiler system professionally installed in your home. Furnaces, while incredibly effective and efficient these days, simply cannot offer you everything a boiler can, such as: Longevity: Boilers have a reputation for long service lives. This is because they have very few mechanical moving parts and therefore do not wear down as fast over time. Fewer repairs: Since there are fewer moving parts, this also means there is less of a need for boiler repairs over the years. Efficiency: Water serves as a better heat transfer method than air, so a boiler can heat your home faster and more efficiently than other systems. Better indoor air quality: Forced-air systems use ductwork, where dust and debris can gather, to be dispersed through your home. The radiant power of a boiler is clean, eliminating air quality problems. Your household will be affected by far fewer contaminants and allergens, creating a healthier environment for your entire family. Boiler Replacement Services While boilers typically have a long lifespan, they will – like most things – eventually reach a limit. If you have an existing boiler that has seen better days and is beyond repair, All American Plumbing Heating & Air can help with boiler replacement services. When replacing your boiler, it’s important to turn to a licensed team you can trust. We will help you find the right replacement boiler for your heating needs and install it quickly and affordably. In addition, we’ll provide you with a recommended maintenance schedule to keep your boiler replacement unit running efficiently and effectively for years to come. Emergency Boiler Repair While boilers don’t have as many moving parts as the traditional furnace, they are not invincible. Every so often, homeowners will find themselves in need of emergency boiler repair. Because of the way boilers work (distributing hot water through pipes in the home), damage to these systems can be extremely problematic. At All American Plumbing Heating & Air, we understand that time is of the essence when it comes to emergency boiler repair, which is why we are on standby accepting calls 24/7 for our customers in need. We Offer Boiler Repair & Maintenance Boilers might not need as many repair services as the average forced-air heater, but they are not invulnerable. At some point during your boiler’s lifespan, you may need to call a heating service professional to fix a leak, find the source of an odd noise, or restore heating power. Fortunately, you needn’t look far for trained and licensed heating technicians who are available 24/7 for all your heating repair needs. To ensure your boiler needs as few repairs as possible throughout the years, and that it lasts as long as it should, be sure to schedule routine maintenance with our team.
