Radiant heating is a type of whole-home heating system that you may have heard referred to as “in-floor heating.” This type of heating method warms your home from the ground up, using tubes or coils installed in your flooring. These tubes and coils are then heated using either water or electricity. The benefits of radiant heating include: More consistent heating throughout the home, and fewer cold spotsLower energy bills than with forced-air systems as radiant heat systems use less electricityReduction of dust and germs in your home’s airBetter overall air quality than seen with forced-air systemsReduced wear and tear of the system as radiant heat systems are protected by your flooring Radiant heating requires professional installation, and it is recommended that you work with HVAC technicians whom you trust and who have extensive experience installing and repairing these types of systems, like ours at All American Plumbing, Heating & Air.
