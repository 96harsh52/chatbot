The water going in and out of your business flows through the system in one direction only. Your plumbing brings fresh water into your property from its municipal source, and your sewer line removes wastewater. However, when the pressure in the system drops or changes, backflow can occur, and sewage from your sewer line can flow back into your plumbing, contaminating your fresh water supply. If left unchecked, backflow can endanger the water supply going to other homes and businesses in the area as well, creating a severe problem, leaving you potentially liable. A fully functioning backflow prevention device reduces the likelihood of this happening and automatically stops backflow from contaminating the water supply. Call our Backflow prevention experts.

How often should a backflow preventer be tested? A backflow preventer is an essential device that works to keep your home’s water flowing in one direction. Without it, your water may become contaminated and unsafe. Because of the seriousness in nature of a failing backflow preventer, it is important to have the device inspected annually. Backflow preventers may break down because of an accumulation of debris, damage, or the age of the unit. It only takes an hour or less to do the testing and it is worth it in the long run. When it comes time to schedule your yearly test, call us. We serve Los Banos, Turlock, Patterson and Merced and we can help!
