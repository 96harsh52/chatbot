Plan to work with them in the future. Finch Heli 2022-01-24 Geeks5G did an outstanding job with my SEO requirements. I saw a 75% jump in traffic due to what David and his team did for us. David is easy to work with and takes time to explain the ins-and-outs of what needs to be done. I will be using Geeks5G for all of my website projects in the future. heiad white 2022-01-23 Geeks5G does an excellent job with their SEO Services, end of story. They are prompt, responsive, and adaptive to my company's needs. They are understanding, yet firm, in making sure that you understand the importance of their work, and how your decisions affect your overall success. velez vera 2022-01-22 Courteous and frank. Could have roped us in to something we couldn't afford and wouldn't have helped. Instead, gave us good pointers and told us that their SEO services wouldn't be worth our expenses. Thank you Geeks5G! Quinton McDonald 2022-01-21 Geeks5G took my ideas and content and did a great job in creating a website for our program. Their technical and creative suggestions helped relay complex program information in an easy-to-read and easy-to-access format. My questions and inquiries were answered promptly. They even helped me promote the website beyond the local level. Nicholas Hinderliter 2022-01-20 Geeks5G is fantastic. Alexa did an amazing design for our website and can’t believe the results we are getting! Thank you so much! gross villa 2022-01-19 I worked with Geeks5G on a single project but all I can say is that they are extremely professional and a great marketing company whose services have been recommended by many in internet marketing groups especially when it comes to link building and content marketing. Thank you guys so much! Robert Dobson 2022-01-18 David at Geeks5G did a thorough site audit of our website-in-development in order to increase our organic SEO. This was not an automated quickie audit. He added many lists showing specific pages on our site which require changes. In addition, he conducted an extensive telephone call with me to explain their findings. All for a very reasonable fee. I plan on continuing to work with them! Felton Gall 2022-01-17 I have been working with Geeks5G in Austin for about 4 months. My website ranking continues to improve. Most importantly we are getting leads. I believe we're ahead of plan. In the world of SEO there are a lot of companies that lack experience and promise the world. By definition SEO is a tough term to define from company to company. I have owned a digital company in the past so I'm a little ahead of the curve in regards to SEO knowledge and expectations. Travis has had opportunities to up-sell me, but instead offered alternative advice that didn't make him money. Don't see that often. They are a solid company. William Luna 2022-01-16 We are currently using their services and we couldn't be happier. They are delivering on what they promised and are head of the game. The team responds back timely and is extremely knowledgeable, without hesitation to give insight and advice. We are 3 months in and our website traffic is increasing, we credit Geeks5G for that.
